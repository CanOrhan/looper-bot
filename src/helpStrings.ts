const mana = `\`\`\` 
First,

Use the calculator to check Forbidden rite damage, it must be less than your ward
If not, then remove Mind Over Matter Keystone. Because FR damage will delete your mana with MoM keystone.

Second,

In your helmet, the first socket should be blue and put Summon skeleton is that socket

Third,

If you are using rare ring
Use gem links FR level 1 + CWDT 12
No exceptions, always use these in the gloves

Fourth,

Put your skill gems in the last socket of weapon and body armour.
The skill gems should not be first gem in weapon and body, put support gems first!

Fifth,

Get reduced cost of mana skills boots enchant, also reduced mana cost on tree. Last Option.

Sixth,

Don't use too many skills in loop
